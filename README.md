# Racing Game

Hey!

   - Open the project in Unity.

2. **Start the Game**  
   - Press the Play button at the top.
   - Use the arrow keys or WASD to drive your car.
   - as of now only traffic and the road spline has been created, explore the parking lot for now!

## Features

- Drive a car around
- Simple controls (arrow keys or WASD)
